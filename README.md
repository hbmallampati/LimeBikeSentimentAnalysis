## LimeBikeSentimentAnalysis
For my Lime Bike Sentiment Analysis project for Software product development course, I collected user reviews and ratings from the Google Play Store to gain insights into user feedback and satisfaction with the Lime Bike app. To collect this data, I used scraping techniques to extract relevant information from the reviews. I then preprocessed the data to remove irrelevant information and perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. I classified each review into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories, and identified the most common issues or complaints mentioned in the reviews. To visualize the results, I created various charts and graphs, such as bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds. These visualizations provided a quick overview of the most common sentiments and issues found in the reviews. The insights gained from the sentiment analysis were used to improve the Lime Bike app and user experience.
